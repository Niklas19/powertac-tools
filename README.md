Repository for utilities and analysis tools relevant to the Power TAC simulation environment.

The core element at the moment is the logtool framework, and some examples of its use in logtool-examples. These are intended to support extraction of data from the server state logs. The assumption at this point is that these tools will be used for data extraction, summarization, and formatting, while the plotting and analysis will be done with Matlab or SciPy or R or some other tool suited for data analysis.
