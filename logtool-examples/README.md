## Power TAC logtool analyzer examples

This package contains several examples of state-log analyzers built on the Power TAC logtool framework. Each of them is a class that extends `LogtoolContext` and implements `Analyzer`, and each is intended to be run as a "main" class, wrapping the framework. Unless you are actively developing the framework, it is not necessary to compile it, since it is deployed and maven will find it.
